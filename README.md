# Project 7: Machine Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on applying machine learning techniques to a dataset using Python. It involves data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
## Steps for Project

### Part 1 - Chart a Straight Line
- **Objective:** Visualize the relationship between Celsius and Fahrenheit.

### Part 2 - Predict Avg High Temp in NYC in January
1. **Section 1 - Data Acquisition**
   - Load the dataset from the specified file path.
  
2. **Section 2 - Data Inspection**
   - Inspect the first and last few rows of the dataset.
  
3. **Section 3 - Data Cleaning**
   - Clean the data to ensure accuracy and usability.
  
4. **Section 4 - Descriptive Statistics**
   - Calculate basic statistics for the dataset.

5. **Section 5 - Build the Model**
   - Set up the model for prediction.

6. **Section 6 - Predict**
   - Make predictions for the average high temperature.

7. **Section 7 - Visualizations**
   - Create visual representations of the data and predictions.

### Part 3 - Predict Avg High Temp in NYC in January (2nd method)
1. **Section 1 - Build the Model**
   - Implement the second prediction method.

2. **Section 2 - Data Inspection**
   - Display the first few rows and summary statistics of the dataset.

3. **Section 3 - Test the Model**
   - Make predictions on the test set and evaluate model performance.

4. **Section 4 - Visualizations**
   - Create visualizations comparing actual and predicted temperatures.

### Part 4 - Insights and Comparison
- **Objective:** Provide insights and compare the two methods used for predicting average high temperatures.
- **Comparison of Methods**
  - Discuss strengths and weaknesses of each method.
  
- **Conclusion**
  - Summarize findings and implications for future work.

## How to Install and Run the Project

### 1. Create a Virtual Environment
To create a virtual environment, run:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate
```
### 2. Activate the Virtual Environment
On Windows, activate it by running:
```bash
.venv\Scripts\Activate
```
### 3. Install Required Packages

Install the necessary packages using:
```bash
py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Alternatively, install the packages individually with:
```bash
py -m pip install jupyterlab
py -m pip install numpy
py -m pip install pandas
py -m pip install matplotlib
py -m pip install scipy
py -m pip install pyarrow
```
### 4. Running the Project
We can run the analysis using the Jupyter Notebook or a Python script:

--For Jupyter Notebook: Launch Jupyter Lab with:
```
jupyter lab

--For Python Script: If applicable, run the script with:
```
python main.py

## Usage
This project allows you to analyze salary data based on age, visualize the distributions, and build a linear regression model to predict salaries
