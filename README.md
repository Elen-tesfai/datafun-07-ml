# DataFun-07-ml
# Project 7: Machine Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on applying machine learning techniques to a dataset using Python. It involves data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## How to Install and Run the Project

### 1. Create a Virtual Environment
To create a virtual environment, run:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
```
### 2. Activate the Virtual Environment
On Windows, activate it by running:

.\.venv\Scripts\activate

### 3. Install Required Packages
Install the necessary packages using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 4. Running the Project
We can run the analysis using the Jupyter Notebook or a Python script:

--For Jupyter Notebook: Launch Jupyter Lab with:
```
jupyter lab
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
Open elent_ml_v2.ipynb and run the cells sequentially.

--For Python Script: If applicable, run the script with:
```
python main.py

## Usage
This project allows you to analyze salary data based on age, visualize the distributions, and build a linear regression model to predict salaries.
